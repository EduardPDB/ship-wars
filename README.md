This is a multiplayer ship wars games.
Here is the link where you can play it: http://shipwars.great-site.net

This was made with php, mysql, html, css and javascript.
No framework has been used for this project and I have created an MVC system that handles the API requests.

The MVC framework that I have created has nice features like:
 - who did it (automaticaly set the user_id who updated | added | deleted an row in mysql)
 - when it was added | updated | deleted (automaticaly set the date when updated | added | deleted an row in mysql)
 - permissions
 - ignore permissions
 - functions for easier queries or adding updating or deleting rows.
